# Anubrat Sahoo

EVM-Focused Systems Engineer building deterministic on-chain infrastructure.

I design failure-safe smart contract systems where state transitions are explicit, verifiable, and adversarially aware. My focus is correctness, settlement logic, and production-grade backend coordination around EVM contracts.

---

## 🔭 Current Focus

- EVM fundamentals (storage, memory, calldata, gas mechanics)
- Intent-based settlement systems
- Escrow contracts with explicit state machines
- Invariant-driven smart contract testing
- On-chain / off-chain synchronization architectures

---

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

- Every state transition must be intentional and traceable.
- Funds should move only through deterministic validation.
- Failure cases matter more than happy paths.
- Security assumptions must be documented.
- Architecture > shortcuts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Smart Contracts
- Solidity
- Hardhat / Foundry
- ethers.js
- OpenZeppelin (audited primitives)

### Backend Systems
- Node.js / Express
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Event-driven patterns
- AWS (Fargate, CloudFront, CI/CD)

### Frontend
- React / Next.js
- TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS

## 🏗 Flagship Direction

### Intent-Based Settlement Protocol

A production-style escrow system where:

- Users define an exact execution outcome
- Funds are locked under explicit state constraints
- Settlement only occurs on verified fulfillment
- Funds remain reclaimable under defined failure states
- State transitions are enforced at the contract level

Designed with:
- Clear state diagrams
- Invariant testing
- Edge-case simulation
- Gas-conscious design

---

## 🔍 Technical Interests

- EVM storage layout & gas optimization
- Reentrancy and state consistency
- Formalized state machines in Solidity
- Deterministic execution guarantees
- Backend relayers & contract coordination
- Contract upgrade safety patterns

---

## 🚀 Open To

- Protocol engineering roles
- Smart contract infrastructure teams
- Backend-heavy Web3 systems
- Early-stage EVM-native startups

If you are building infrastructure that must survive adversarial conditions, I’m interested.
